# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose up`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### About the project

This project looks like todo list. Here you can create any record, then mark it as ready and if you want, then delete.
And there is any sorting. I used react js, redux, material ui, docker for this project.
